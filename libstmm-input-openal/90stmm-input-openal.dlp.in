#=#+#=# description
Plugin for the stmm-input-dl library that provides playback capability
for sound output devices and an event type that informs event listeners
about sound termination.
Because of OpenAl's "not so good" device management, when multiple devices
are present (ex. ear-phones), you might have to unplug and re-plug a device
to make them work.
Also note that if a sound is placed in space other than at the listener's
position it might only "sound right" if it is in mono.
