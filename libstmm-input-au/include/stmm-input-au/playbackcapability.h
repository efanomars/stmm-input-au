/** The playback capability of a device.
 * Devices with this capability can generate "sound finished" events.
 *
 * Note: the reference system is flipped by 180 degrees around the x axis
 * compared with the coordinates of your typical screen. That is you should
 * negate y and z coordinates when setting the position of listener and sounds.
 *
 * This interface is very simple and limited compared to what OpenAL can do.
 * The orientation of the listener cannot be changed, the direction of sounds
 * and their sound cone cannot be set, etc.
 *
 * If the listener is at position (0,0,0), the up direction is (0,1,0), the
 * left direction is (-1,0,0), the behind direction is (0,0,1).
 *
 * The user of this interface can assume that the listener's initial position
 * is (0,0,0) and the listener volume is 1.
 *
 * When one of the playSound methods is called, an event listener (added to the
 * device manager managing the device implementing this capability) can expect
 * to receive a SndFinishedEvent when the sound has finished playing or the
 * device was removed. A listeners being removed will receive the SndFinishedEvent
 * only if it was added with the finalization flag.
